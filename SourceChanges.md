### Details ###

  * Added IGNORE\_PARASOFT\_ANALYSIS
> > Auto-generated code often does not conform to java/cs coding standards enable this if you have problem with Parasoft's coding analysis.
  * Move project type from maven to NetBeans system.
> > This project has using only one external jar for unit testing so using maven for dependencies is extreme waste of build time. A I like NetBeans IDE :)
